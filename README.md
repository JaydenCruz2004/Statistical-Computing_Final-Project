Final Project for DSC 2010 Statistical Computing

Course Desciption: Students will learn to manipulate data and process information using an appropriate programming language (e.g. R, Python).  No previous programming experience is assumed.  Students will use data from multiple sources including experiments or surveys, local industry/non-profit partners, and public data sets.  Throughout the course students will analyze data using statistical and data science techniques.  Students will become proficient at selecting the data of interest from large tabular sources, and applying sample aggregate functions (e.g. max, mean) as well as more complex statistical tests.  Appropriate use of computers and software will be integrated into the laboratory and data analysis experience.
